# Tic-Tac-toe
This project is a classic Tic Tac Toe (O-X) game implemented in Python, played on a 3×3 grid. The game pits the user against the computer, where each player alternately marks a cell with either X or O. The objective is to align three of your symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally before your opponent does.
